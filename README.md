# tweaksLauncher
this is the first project i make outside of schools it is based on java and linux only i expect to learn a lot from it and if you see anything i should learn just tell me! im making this before i make the app so you probably wont see a lot but i will write when its ready:)

# WHY?
well i dont want to specify my age but im young, i want to get to some place that will require expirience and i belive that if i start early then i will get a lead
also i never touched things like guis and most libraries and never did anything involving linux systems(ubuntu cause its what im on) so this project is more of a learning expirience for me that will also be usefull just for myself

# ABOUT
this launcher should just be like steam but with WAYYY less features just kinda like the add own game and the play button lol

WISH ME LUCK!
