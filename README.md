# tweaksLauncher
this is the first project i make outside of schools it is based on java and linux only i expect to learn a lot from it and if you see anything i should learn just tell me! im making this before i make the app so you probably wont see a lot but i will write when its ready:)

# WHY?
well i dont want to specify my age but im young, i want to get to some place that will require expirience and i belive that if i start early then i will get a lead
also i never touched things like guis and most libraries and never did anything involving linux systems(ubuntu cause its what im on) so this project is more of a learning expirience for me that will also be usefull just for myself

# ABOUT
this launcher should just be like steam but with WAYYY less features just kinda like the add own game and the play button lol

# UPDATE
i just finished the first version and im very proud of myself my code is kind of messy and with no comments BUT in the gui part which i made 70% on my own but then light mode burnt my eyes and i couldnt figure out how to make dynamic buttons so yeah that part's chatgpt work not mine but the programHandler is 100% me.
current features:
you can add games by paths.
you can add games by name and if its easily findable(for linux i use a command idk how it works lol) then it adds it.
complete gui that looks like garbage and will forever.
multiple apps in the same time --unintentional i kinda thought it wont work but for some reason it does.

current "features"
it can search your whole system! but it fails 99% of the time and you cant cancel it .
for some unkown reason i didnt want to research it all opens under the inteliji thing so you need to hover on it and pick your program.
dont do things wrong it will crash everything.

# things i had to learn
VERY basic swing and how to tell chatgpt to do the little bit harder part.
json reading + writing(no creating tho the file comes with it).
adding try and catch + throw ioexception anytime inteliji orders me to.
using processbuilder and some linux commands.

# do i recommend using it?
no at least not for now but if you want you can look around the code and laugh at me:D
